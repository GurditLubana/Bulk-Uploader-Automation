# Bulk Uploader Automation Bookmarklet

## Overview

This JavaScript bookmarklet automates the process of extracting policy numbers from document names and filling in the necessary fields in a bulk uploader interface.

## Background

At Wawanesa, the Documents Uploader tool is used to upload important documents to a platform for storing documents and data. Manually entering policy numbers for each document can be a time-consuming task, taking an average of 20-30 seconds per policy. For large batches of 30 or more policies, this process can take at least 15 minutes. This bookmarklet significantly reduces this time to just 1 second for all the policies combined.

## Benefits

- Reduces the average time to upload policies from 15 minutes to just 1 second for all policies.
- Simplifies and speeds up the document uploading process.
